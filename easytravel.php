Over the years, tens of thousands of tourists have arrived at the point via cruise ship. But those ships have anchored nearby and brought passengers ashore via small boats called tenders.
That will soon change.</p>

<p>For instance, Disney can’t tender. The ship that comes to Alaska does not have tender boats on it. So we have talked to Disney about stopping in once we have the dock,” she says.
Disney did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation. Banaszak said another line that only uses tender boats occasionally may also be interested.</p>

            <h1>Brown Bear Lodge Stream Fishing</h1>
          </div>
          <p>Are you ready for a stream fishing adventure that you will keep with you for the rest of your life?
            Chichagof Island grants the renowned salmon and trout fishing experience you’ve probably heard about, and Brown Bear Lodge will take you there. On our fishing expedition, you  will be provided with an ultra light spinning rod casting artificial lures .  We provide your fishing poles, as well as gear and tackle, and help or assistance for any experience level. Whether you are a seasoned expert or a first-timer, we guarantee that the stream fishing trip will be a highlight of your trip to Alaska. Angling opportunities include Dolly Varden trout, Cutthroat trout, Pink (Humpy) salmon, Chum (Dog) salmon, Coho (Silver) salmon, and Steelhead.</p>
          <p>Alaska is well-known for its fishing opportunities, and for good reason. Locals frequently report landing literally one-hundred or more fish on any given day. A few hours at one of the cool, gorgeous streams can show you that this is no fish story! Our fishing expert has had more than 45 years of experience angling and truly enjoys being able to guide guests through the coveted Alaska experience. He is dedicated to making this trip of yours one to remember.</p>
          <p>In addition to your unforgettable fishing emprise, you will most likely encounter some brown bears and other wildlife during your day trip. Chichagof Island has more than one bear per square mile, making their population greater than that of the people living here. While out on your stream fishing excursion, you may also encounter mink, marten, otter, beavers, and squirrels; not to mention a number of stunning bald eagles - so don’t forget your camera!</p>
          <p>If your ideal Alaskan adventure is one where you are free from bumping into other tourists, free to take pictures or catch fish at your own leisure, and just plain enjoying the fresh air and scenic beauty and the creatures of the Alaskan outdoors, this may be the opportunity you have been waiting for. </p>
          <p>The fishing trip you have always dreamed of is waiting for you in Hoonah, Alaska - and Brown Bear Lodge wants to share it with you!</p>
