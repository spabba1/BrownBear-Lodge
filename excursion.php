            <h1>Brown Bear Lodge Wildlife Excursion</h1>
          </div>
          <p>Chichagof Island has been named “Bear Island” by National Geographic because it has the highest concentration of bears in the world at 1-2 brown bears per square mile. Brown Bear Lodge - rightly named - has a desire to share this sensational creature with you!</p>
          <p>Our flexible wildlife excursion puts the Last Frontier at your fingertips. There is no itinerary set in stone; we want you to experience wild Alaska how you would like! We encourage guests to articulate their preferences so that we can accommodate their needs on a group-by-group basis. There are many exciting things to experience, such as a brisk walk in a muskeg, a short hike for picking some of the ten varieties of edible berries found on the island, viewing an old growth forest, and coming face to face with some of the key attractions of Alaska’s wilderness - brown bears! </p>
          <p>Alaskan brown bears are most commonly seen near the streams, pulling ripe salmon out with their paws or feasting on the superfluous blueberry patches among the brush.  During many tours, bears are even seen on the road! Depending on current bear  movements, feeding habits, and daytime temperatures, there are short stops in key locations to scope out a magnificent view of these captivating creatures - and your Wildlife Guide knows them all. He can give you a detailed and entertaining narration about the area, from the town and the Tlingit Native population to everything you could ever want to know about brown bears.</p>
          <p>The Chichagof forests also host an array of other wildlife that are quite frequently spotted during excursions, including mink, pacific marten, red squirrels, otter, beaver, ducks and sea birds, Sitka black-tail deer, and plenty of bald eagles: so be sure to bring your camera!</p>
          <p>Brown Bear Lodge Wildlife Excursion is your best bet for a truly unique adventure. With so much area to travel, you have the chance to really get away from the crowd. If you want to separate yourself from the other tourists, have a change of pace from being packed in a boat or walking single file waiting for a chance to get a look, and want to create memories of Alaska that you will still be talking about years from now, we look forward to seeing you at Brown Bear Lodge!</p>

            <h1>Brown Bear Lodge Stream Fishing</h1>
          </div>
          <p>Are you ready for a stream fishing adventure that you will keep with you for the rest of your life?
            Chichagof Island grants the renowned salmon and trout fishing experience you’ve probably heard about, and Brown Bear Lodge will take you there. On our fishing expedition, you  will be provided with an ultra light spinning rod casting artificial lures .  We provide your fishing poles, as well as gear and tackle, and help or assistance for any experience level. Whether you are a seasoned expert or a first-timer, we guarantee that the stream fishing trip will be a highlight of your trip to Alaska. Angling opportunities include Dolly Varden trout, Cutthroat trout, Pink (Humpy) salmon, Chum (Dog) salmon, Coho (Silver) salmon, and Steelhead.</p>
          <p>Alaska is well-known for its fishing opportunities, and for good reason. Locals frequently report landing literally one-hundred or more fish on any given day. A few hours at one of the cool, gorgeous streams can show you that this is no fish story! Our fishing expert has had more than 45 years of experience angling and truly enjoys being able to guide guests through the coveted Alaska experience. He is dedicated to making this trip of yours one to remember.</p>
          <p>In addition to your unforgettable fishing emprise, you will most likely encounter some brown bears and other wildlife during your day trip. Chichagof Island has more than one bear per square mile, making their population greater than that of the people living here. While out on your stream fishing excursion, you may also encounter mink, marten, otter, beavers, and squirrels; not to mention a number of stunning bald eagles - so don’t forget your camera!</p>
          <p>If your ideal Alaskan adventure is one where you are free from bumping into other tourists, free to take pictures or catch fish at your own leisure, and just plain enjoying the fresh air and scenic beauty and the creatures of the Alaskan outdoors, this may be the opportunity you have been waiting for. </p>
          <p>The fishing trip you have always dreamed of is waiting for you in Hoonah, Alaska - and Brown Bear Lodge wants to share it with you!</p>
